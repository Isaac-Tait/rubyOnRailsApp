# README

Welcome to my Ruby on Rails project...

* Chore:  
No Procfile detected, using the default web server.
remote:        
We recommend explicitly declaring how to boot your server process via a Procfile.
remote:

* After pushing code to GitHub you will need to run `git push heroku main` to push the updates to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/thawing-sands-95218

* `rails s` to launch localhost:3000
